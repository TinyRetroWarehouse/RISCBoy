CPU Synth Results
=================

Results are cells (LUT4 + DFF + CARRY + BRAM). Number of iCE40 logic cells occupied should be lower due to colocation after place + route.

* acc080a (old frontend, as close to working as it got): 5454 (note it seems that this may have had a reset on register file, which prevented BRAM inference. Need to check for fair comparison.)
* 0da3761 (new frontend, nearly working): 2765
* 4e8c3bb (fix some AHB stuff): 2856
* a6ed35f (Write M result directly to register file; simplify bypass network as a result): 2676
* e7b46aa (Some minor fixes following porting some RISC-V compliance tests): 2681
